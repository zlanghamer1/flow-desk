# CLAUDE.md — direction for Claude sessions working on flow-desk

## What this is
Flow Desk is a personal options-flow dashboard: a static GitHub Pages site
(`index.html`) plus a GitHub Actions loop (`fetcher/`) that pulls free CBOE +
TradingView data, scores it onto two boards, and publishes `data.json` +
`history.json` to the `data` branch, which the site reads live.

## Doc authority (read before changing behavior)
- **DATA_CONTRACT.md** — authoritative for the `data.json` / `history.json`
  shape. Change a field here first, then match the code and the site.
- **README.md** — the canonical user-facing, plain-English truth. Keep its voice.
- **DEPLOY.md** — ops only (deploy method, loop lifecycle).

## Model-role convention for work on this repo
- **Fable** — architect; rules on scope and gives final approval.
- **Opus** — directs traffic; synthesizes reviews into build specs.
- **Sonnet** — builds (writes the code and docs).
- **Haiku** — mechanical grunt work.

## Hard guardrails
- **Never** push the `data` branch by hand — the loop force-pushes it every
  cycle; a manual push will be clobbered or will fight the loop.
- **Never** flip Settings → Pages to "GitHub Actions" mode. Branch mode from
  `gh-pages` is intentional (see DEPLOY.md).
- **Never** re-add the deliberately-excluded tickers — BESIY, IFNNY, SPX,
  VIX, SPMO — without first reading the exclusion note in
  `fetcher/build_snapshot.py`. (NRGU and WTI were reinstated 2026-08-15 by
  Zach's full TV-list ruling — NRGU is TRACK_ONLY, and WTI is W&T Offshore
  equity, not crude; both cases are documented in that same note.)
- Keep `index.html`'s `TIPS` text in sync with `build_snapshot.py` scoring
  whenever weights change — the two describe the same methodology and must not
  drift.
- Forced test runs off-hours are fine for `data.json`, but must **not** create
  weekend/closed history sessions. `build_snapshot.run_cycle` guards this
  (`write_history = market_state != "closed"`) — do not remove that guard.

## Decision history
Lives in the ClaudeVault repo under `market-data/flow-desk/`.
